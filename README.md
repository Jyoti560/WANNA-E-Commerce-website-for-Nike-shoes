A simple and responsive e-commerce website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project demonstrates a basic online store with product listings, a shopping cart, and checkout functionality.
This project is a frontend-based e-commerce website designed to mimic the core functionalities of a typical online shopping platform. It is created using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it a great learning resource for beginners and intermediate web developers looking to understand how online stores work at a basic level.

The website allows users to browse products, add items to their shopping cart, view totals, and simulate a checkout. All interactions happen on the client side using JavaScript and Local Storage, which keeps the cart data persistent across page reloads without using a backend or database.
